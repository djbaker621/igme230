            My name is Dylan Baker, currently enrolled as a New Media Interactive Development major at the Rochester Institute of Techology. New Media majors are taught everything from graphic design and typography to coding and animating. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

        <h1>About Site Creation</h1>
        <p>
            Site creation took a few hours, although planning and mapping was done prior to actual html and css. My biggest challenge when creating the website was layout, of all things, because I could never get the layout of the page to look right the first time around. After about an hour of fiddling with it, everything fell into place and it was pretty smooth from there on. Most of the site is done using flexbox except the resume portion, in which the display is in grid format.
